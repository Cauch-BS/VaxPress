VaxPress
********

VaxPress is a codon optimizer platform tailored for mRNA vaccine development. 
It refines coding sequences starting from protein or RNA sequences to boost both storage stability and in vivo protein expression. 
Plus, additional properties can be easily programmed into the optimization process with just a few lines of code via a pluggable interface.
